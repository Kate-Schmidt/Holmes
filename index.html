        <p>The Sherlock Holmes series was written by British author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It features Sherlock Holmes a fictional detective of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who first appeared in publication in 1887. A brilliant London-based detective, Holmes is famous for his prowess at using logic and astute observation to solve cases. He is often accompanied by Dr. John Watson, an army surgeon who was wounded in battle, and has returned to England in impaired health. He is seen as Holmes's one friend and confidant, along with the narrator of the stories. He provides the essential core of humanity that is often hard to find in Holmes.</p>

        <h3>Joseph Bell - Original Sherlock</h3>
        <p>Dr. Joseph Bell was a Scottish surgeon and lecturer at the medical school of the University of Edinburgh in the 19th century. He was also one of Conan Doyle's medical school professors at the University of Edinburgh Medical School.  He used methods of observation and deduction on his patients and Doyle was very impressed by his teacher's methods. This was his inspiration for the creation of Sherlock Holmes. That's why Joseph Bell was often named as "The Original of Sherlock Holmes".</p>
