        <h3>Joseph Bell- Original Sherlock</h3>
        <p>Dr. Joseph Bell was a Scottish surgeon and lecturer at the medical school of the University of Edinburgh in the 19th century. He was also one of Conan Doyle's medical school professors at the University of Edinburgh Medical School.  He used methods of observation and deduction on his patients and Doyle was very impressed by his teacher's methods. This was his inspiration for the creation of Sherlock Holmes. That's why Joseph Bell was often named as "The Original of Sherlock Holmes".</p>
