               <!--whc: the circle above assumes that you want to show the proportion of the story that is quotes, 
        which turns out to be a lot. The original plan instead was just to count the number of the quotes, so 
        if you want to do that, change it so it's counting quotes instead of doing string-join and string-length.
        Once you've got that, you can use similar code to count the number of characters and the number of refs.--></g>
