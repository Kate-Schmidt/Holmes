        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        
        <p>As of 2023 all Sherlock Stories had entered the public domain. Knowing this we decided that it would be fun to analyze such a well-known piece of media especially since it was newly released. We decided to look at the first novel A Study in Scarlet, and at the first collection of short stories The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. We choose to analyze how much each character spoke and was referenced, the different types of mysteries, and the length difference between each story.</p>
